## Purpose:
The purpose of the Belly Button Biodiversity project is to identify a bacterial candidate for the customer, Improbable Beef, to use for manufacturing synthetic beef. 

## Method: 
The analyst used voluteers who identified the top ten bacterial in their belly buttons. The analyst used both metadata and sample data collected and visualized the results in a dashboard. The dashboard shows three different charts that highlight the data collected for each volunteer. 
Viewers of the dashboard are able to select a volunteer ID and see demographic data and the results of bacteria found for the volunteer selected. 

Demographic for each volunteer in the study includes: 
	- ID
	- Ethnicity 
	- Gender
	- Age
	- Location 
	- Belly Button Type
	- Washing Frequency


Charts visualize: 
	- Bar Chart - the top ten cultures found per volunteer ID
	- Bubble Chart - all bacteria culture per sample by volunteer
	- Gauge Chart - the number of washing completed per week by the volunteer 

## Results
The interactive dashboard highlights the results of the study. In eviewing the results visualized on the dashboard, Improbable Beef, is able to identify bacterial found in cultures collected from voluteers.
